    Locate the directory of a file.

    Periodically, you'll want to know where a Python source file is actually
    located on disk.  You might want this for all sorts of reasons, and it's
    always a bit messy when you do want to know.

    DirectoryLocalizer solves two problems:
        1. it lets you know where you are on disk, assuming you're not
        anywhere crazy, like in a zip import, and
        2. it lets you pass that location to other code that might want
        to know where you are.

    Usage is extremely simple:
        1. Make a DirectoryLocalizer object, dl (or whatever).
        2. Call dl.set() from the file you want to locate on disk.
        3. Any code that can access dl can now call:
            dl.dir(): for the directory of the file where dl.set()
            was called,
            dl.path(fn): for the filename of a file in the directory
            where dl.set() was called,
            dl.file(fn): for a file object of the file in dl.path(fn), and
            dl.read(fn): to get a read of the file in d.file(fn).
